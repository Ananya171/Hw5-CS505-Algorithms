# CS505- Diff algorithm

1. hashfile.py - for computing the hash values of each input text file.
This file can be run on any command line with only the Python version 3 and giving the test file's path directory as an argument.
$ python3 hashfile.py f1.txt

2. diff.py - for implementing the diff program.
This file can be run on any command line with only the Python version 3 and giving the 2 test file's path directory as arguments.
$ python3 diff.py f1.txt f2.txt

3. diffprint.py- for implementing the diff program and giving the output in terms of each line in the contents of the file 
This file can be run on any command line with only the Python version 3 and giving the 2 test file's path directory as arguments.
$ python3 diffprint.py f1.txt f2.txt

4. hashfile.sh - the bash script that run the hashfile.py file on the command line interface.  
This file can be run on any command line with if the system supports python version 3 and giving the test file's path directory as an argument.
$ ./hashfile.sh f1.txt

5. diff.sh - the bash script that run the diff.py file on the command line interface.
This file can be run on any command line with if the system supports python version 3 and giving the 2 test file's path directory as arguments.
$ ./diff.sh f1.txt f2.txt

6. diffprint.sh - the bash script that run the diffprint.py file on the command line interface.
This file can be run on any command line with if the system supports python version 3 and giving the 2 test file's path directory as arguments.
$ ./diffprint.sh f1.txt f2.txt

Keep all the bash scripts, the .py files and run the bash scripts on the
